# Contributing to Dea/L0

Thanks for contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Dea/L0 project, including development
setup, coding conventions, and testing.

Dea/L0 now lives under `l0/` inside the Dea monorepo. Unless a section says otherwise, run the commands in this document
from the `l0/` directory.

## Scope and status

Dea/L0 is experimental. The language, compiler CLI, and runtime APIs may change without notice.

At this point of the Dea/L0 project, we are focused on building a solid foundation for the compiler and language design.
This means that internal refactors, API changes, and design iterations are expected and welcome. However, we are not yet
concerned with building a stable public API or ensuring backward compatibility.

The focus is on correctness, maintainability, and code quality over performance optimizations or feature completeness.

## Development setup

Prerequisites:

- A C99 compiler (e.g., GCC) for codegen tests and running compiled programs
- `make` (the primary developer workflow entrypoint)
- Python 3.14+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is recommended, but not required (the `make venv` target uses it automatically
  when available, and falls back to plain `pip`)

For day-to-day development, the `tcc` C compiler is sufficient and fast for codegen tests. Build it from the
[mob development branch](https://repo.or.cz/tinycc.git) (`./configure && make && make install`) if you want to use it,
as distribution packages tend to ship an outdated version.

### Setting up the development environment

For normal development, start with `make venv`: it validates the Python version, creates the shared monorepo virtual
environment under `../.venv`, and installs all dev + docs dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

### Pre-commit hooks

After running `make venv`, install the monorepo hooks once from the repository root:

```bash
uv run --directory l0 --group dev pre-commit install -c .pre-commit-config.yaml
```

Two hooks run on every commit:

- **mdformat** -- auto-formats all `.md` files (line wrap 120, numbered lists, GitHub Flavored Markdown). If it
  reformats a file, stage the changes and commit again.
- **copyright-headers** -- checks that tracked `.c`, `.h`, `.l0`, `.py`, `.sh` files have a copyright notice in the
  first 80 lines.

### Building the compiler(s)

Select the repo-local switchable `l0c` alias (either Stage 1 or Stage 2) so you can use `l0c` in your terminal to test
the intended compiler stage. Each `use-dev-stage*` target builds and installs the corresponding launcher automatically.
For example, to use the Stage 2 L0 compiler:

```bash
make venv
make use-dev-stage2       # use `make use-dev-stage1` to switch to the Stage 1 Python compiler
source build/dea/bin/l0-env.sh
```

If you need both launchers at once (without selecting one), run `make install-dev-stages`. You can override the build
location by setting `DEA_BUILD_DIR`. Dev launchers are built without optimization flags; `make install` and `make dist`
default to `L0_CFLAGS=-O2`.

Note that there is also an internal `./scripts/l0c` entrypoint, which is source-tree Stage 1 only and is used by the
bootstrap mechanics, internal tooling, and Stage 1-focused test scripts. Unless you are working on these specific areas,
prefer the `l0c` alias after `make use-dev-stage*` to ensure you are testing the intended compiler stage.

To override the automatic C compiler selection (e.g., to use `gcc` instead of `tcc` if you have both installed), set the
`L0_CC` environment variable at any time. For example:

```bash
L0_CC=gcc make test-stage2
```

### Running tests

From the `l0/` directory:

```bash
make test-stage1  # runs the Stage 1 test suite (Python compiler)
make test-stage2  # runs the Stage 2 test suite (L0 compiler)
```

For Stage 1 (`compiler/stage1_py`) changes, you can also run specific tests with `pytest`:

```bash
../.venv/bin/python -m pytest compiler/stage1_py/tests/lexer/test_lexer.py
../.venv/bin/python -m pytest -k "test_name" compiler/stage1_py/tests
```

For Stage 2 (`compiler/stage2_l0`) changes, run one of the following Make targets depending on your needs:

```bash
make test-stage2  # runs the standard Stage 2 test suite
make test-stage2 TESTS="driver_test l0c_build_run_test" # runs a specific subset of Stage 2 tests
make test-stage2-trace  # runs the Stage 2 L0-based tests with trace collection and leak triage
make triple-test  # runs only the triple-bootstrap test
```

These Make targets are self-contained repo-local workflows: they ensure `../.venv`, prepare the Stage 2 artifact under
`DEA_BUILD_DIR` (defaults to `./build/dea`), and ignore any previously sourced installed-prefix `L0_*` env.

`make test-stage2-trace` is an important finalization gate for Stage 2 changes because it checks runtime trace health
(including leak triage) across the full Stage 2 test suite.

`make triple-test` is a focused test for the triple-bootstrap process, which is a critical end-to-end validation of the
compiler's ability to build itself and produce a stable artifact.

### Smoke test

Verify the compiler works end-to-end:

```bash
l0c --version # ensure the expected version is printed
l0c -P examples --run hello    # build and run hello.l0
l0c -P examples --check hello  # parse and type-check only
```

### Debugging

Use verbose flags to see compilation stages:

```bash
l0c -v -P examples --check hello     # info-level
l0c -vvv -P examples --check hello   # debug-level
```

## Making changes

1. Fork and create a topic branch.
2. Keep commits small and focused.
3. Add or update tests for behavior changes.
4. Update docs when changing user-visible behavior (syntax, diagnostics, CLI flags).

## Project structure

- `compiler/stage1_py/`: Stage 1 compiler (Python). This is the bootstrap implementation.
- `compiler/stage2_l0/`: Stage 2 compiler (L0). This is the self-hosted implementation.
- `compiler/shared/runtime/`: Runtime library code written in C.
- `compiler/shared/l0/stdlib/`: Dea/L0 standard library code.
- `examples/`: Example L0 programs.
- `docs/`: Design documents, grammar specification, architecture notes, and other documentation.
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for development, testing, and maintenance.
- `tests/`: End-to-end tests that may involve both compiler stages or external tools.

## Coding conventions

- Prefer explicit, simple implementations over cleverness.
- Preserve existing grammar/AST shapes unless the change is staged and justified.
- Error handling: return structured diagnostics (`Diagnostic` objects); avoid silent failures.
- See `docs/reference/design-decisions.md` for rationale behind key language and compiler choices.

### Documentation and styling standards

- **Python:** Use Google Style docstrings (include `Args`, `Returns`, `Raises` sections).
- **C (.h/.c) & L0 (.l0):**
  - **Doxygen:** Use Javadoc format (`/** ... */` with `@param`, `@return` tags). Omit the `@brief` tag; rely on the
    first sentence for the brief description.
  - **License Headers:** Keep `SPDX-License-Identifier` and copyright headers in standard C block comments (`/* ... */`)
    at the top of the file, distinct from Doxygen blocks.
  - **Section Separators:**
    - **C/C++:** Banners must fit within a **79-character maximum line width**. For standard block comment separators,
      use exactly 73 equals signs (`=`):
      ```c
      /* =========================================================================
       * Section name
       * ========================================================================= */
      ```
    - **L0:** Use a shorter format to fit within a 40-character line width, with exactly 33 equals (`=`) or hyphen (
      `-`) signs. The title should stay within 33 characters (introduce a newline if longer).
      ```
      /* =================================
         Section Name
         ================================= */
      ```
      Notice the closing line has exactly 3 leading spaces and 33 signs before the `*/`.

### Commit messages

- Use sentence case with a period at the end (e.g., "Add `byte` type support.").
- For non-trivial changes, include a detailed body describing what changed.
- Use backticks for L0 code snippets and type names.
- AI tools and agents should not add Co-Authored-By lines to commits.

## Pull requests

A PR should include:

- What changed and why (1-3 paragraphs)
- Any relevant issue link(s)
- Tests: added/updated, and how to run them locally
- Notes on backward-compatibility (breaking vs non-breaking)
