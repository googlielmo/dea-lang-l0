# Attic

`docs/attic/` stores superseded or obsolete documents.

Guidelines:

- Keep attic subdirectories aligned with live docs (`reference/`, `specs/`, `implementation/`, `proposals/`, `plans/`).
- Archive only retired docs; routine edits stay in the live tree.
- Prefer the archive naming pattern from `docs/README.md`.
- Add archive metadata at the top of each archived document.
