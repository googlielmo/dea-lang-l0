# L0 Trace Specification

Version: 2026-02-15

This document specifies Stage 1 trace instrumentation for generated C code and runtime behavior.

## 1. Purpose

Trace instrumentation exists to verify ownership and memory code paths at runtime, especially subtle ARC behavior
(`retain`/`release`) and allocation/deallocation flows.

Tracing is opt-in and intended for debugging, validation, and regression analysis.

## 2. User Interface (Stage 1 CLI)

`l0c` exposes trace flags on codegen-producing commands (`gen`, `build`, `run`):

- `--trace-arc`: enable ARC operation tracing.
- `--trace-memory`: enable memory operation tracing.

Flags are independent and composable.

Examples:

```bash
./l0c gen --trace-arc app.main
./l0c build --trace-memory app.main
./l0c run --trace-arc --trace-memory app.main
```

## 3. Generated C Contract

When enabled, generated C emits preprocessor defines immediately before including `l0_runtime.h`:

- `#define L0_TRACE_ARC 1`
- `#define L0_TRACE_MEMORY 1`

These defines gate runtime trace code with `#ifdef` so trace logic is fully excluded when flags are off.

Manual C defines passed via `-C` (for example `-C "-DL0_TRACE_ARC"`) remain compatible.

## 4. Runtime Output Contract

- Trace output stream: `stderr`.
- Prefixes:
    - ARC: `[l0][arc]`
    - Memory: `[l0][mem]`
- Trace format is line-oriented text, one event per line.

No stdout behavior is changed by tracing.

## 5. Trace Families

### 5.1 ARC (`L0_TRACE_ARC`)

ARC traces include retain/release operations and branch outcomes.

Current ARC instrumentation points:

- `rt_string_retain`
- `rt_string_release` path (`_rt_free_string`)

Typical fields include:

- operation (`op=retain` or `op=release`)
- string kind (`static`/`heap`)
- pointer identity
- reference count transition (`rc_before`/`rc_after`) where applicable
- action (`retain`, `keep`, `free`, `noop-*`, or `panic-*`)

### 5.2 Memory (`L0_TRACE_MEMORY`)

Memory traces include allocation/free/reallocation/new/drop paths.

Current memory instrumentation points:

- `rt_alloc`
- `rt_realloc`
- `rt_free`
- `rt_calloc`
- `_rt_alloc_string`
- `_rt_realloc_string`
- `_rt_free_string`
- `_rt_alloc_obj`
- `_rt_drop`

Typical fields include:

- operation name
- size/count arguments
- pointer identities (old/new for realloc)
- action (`ok`, `fail`, `free`, `noop-*`, `panic-*`)

## 6. Compatibility and Defaults

- Tracing is disabled by default.
- Enabling tracing does not change language semantics; it only emits additional `stderr` logs.
- Existing programs compile and run unchanged without trace flags.

## 7. Non-goals (Current Stage)

- Structured trace output formats (JSON/binary).
- Source-location tagging on each trace line.
- Configurable runtime filtering levels/categories.

## 8. Candidate Future Flags

Potential future `trace-*` families:

- `trace-panic`
- `trace-io`
- `trace-hash`
- `trace-newdrop` (if split from general memory tracing)
