# L0 Ownership and Memory Management Reference

This document describes how ownership works in L0 today, covering:

- **`new` / `drop`** — heap object allocation and deallocation.
- **ARC-managed `string`** — reference-counted string values.
- **Container ownership** — how stdlib containers manage the elements they store.
- **`string?` unwrap** — what happens when you write `opt as string` to extract a value from an optional.

## Scope and Status

- The ground truth is the **current implementation**: Stage 1 backend lowering and Stage 2 lexer/parser + stdlib.
- If runtime or codegen behavior differs from this document, treat it as a bug and report it.

## 1. Ownership Model at a Glance

L0 uses three cooperating lifetime systems:

1. **`new` / `drop`** for heap-allocated objects.
2. **ARC** (automatic reference counting) for `string` values, via `rt_string_retain` / `rt_string_release`.
3. **Container-level ownership** rules that govern elements stored inside stdlib collections.

These systems are deliberately separate:

- `_rt_drop` frees the memory that `new` allocated. It does **not** walk ARC references.
- `rt_string_release` frees a string's payload when its refcount reaches zero. It does **not** free `new`-allocated
  object memory.

## 2. Normative Rules Matrix

| Operation                                                                   | Ownership result                      | What you need to do                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `let p = new T(...)`                                                        | Caller owns the heap object           | Call `drop p` exactly once, unless you explicitly transfer ownership elsewhere.                                    |
| Normal L0 assignment of a `string` (`dst = s`, `*dest = val`, field assign) | Destination takes a managed reference | The compiler emits retain/release automatically. Do **not** add manual retain/release around ordinary assignments. |
| Removing or clearing string entries from raw storage                        | Container owns stored strings         | Call `rt_string_release` on each owned string **before** zeroing or removing the storage.                          |
| Byte-copy move (`rt_memcpy`) of string-bearing data                         | Ownership moves with the bytes        | Do **not** release the moved-from slot again — the destination is now the sole owner.                              |
| Bulk zero (`rt_memset`, `arr_zap`) on string-bearing storage                | Zeroing bypasses ARC                  | Release owned strings **first**, then zero.                                                                        |
| `string` returned by value from a container helper                          | Caller receives a managed value       | Follow normal ARC lifetime. Avoid compensating manual releases unless you are crossing a raw-memory boundary.      |

## 3. `new` / `drop` Semantics

How it lowers at runtime:

- `new` → `_rt_alloc_obj(bytes)`.
- `drop` → `_rt_drop(ptr)`.
- `_rt_drop(NULL)` is a safe no-op.
- Dropping a pointer that was not allocated by `new` triggers a runtime panic.

Before calling `_rt_drop`, the compiler may emit field cleanup automatically:

- If the struct/enum has ARC fields (e.g. `string` members), Stage 1 inserts `rt_string_release` calls for those fields
  before freeing the object.
- Pointer fields that own **separate** heap objects are **not** cleaned up automatically — you must free or drop
  children explicitly before dropping the parent.

**Rule of thumb:** if your struct owns child pointers, clean them up yourself before `drop`.

## 4. ARC `string` Semantics

Every `string` value is reference-counted:

- `rt_string_retain` increments the refcount (no-op for static/literal strings).
- `rt_string_release` decrements the refcount and frees the payload when it reaches zero (no-op for statics).

In practice:

- Most ordinary L0 code never needs manual retain/release — the compiler balances ARC automatically on assignments and
  copies.
- Manual retain/release is reserved for **low-level container internals** and **raw-memory boundaries** (see §7).

## 5. Optional Unwrap: `string?` → `string` via `opt as string`

When you have a `string?` (an optional string) and unwrap it with `opt as string`, the result is a plain `string` value.
The key ownership question is: **does the unwrapped value need an extra retain?**

**Short answer:** usually no.

The compiler's Stage 1 lowering already handles this correctly. When you write:

```
let s: string = opt as string
```

the unwrapped string is ownership-stabilized — it is **not** tied to the optional's cleanup path, so it will not be
prematurely released when the optional goes out of scope.

The same applies to:

- Returning an unwrapped `string?` from a function.
- Passing an unwrapped `string?` into a container (e.g. `vs_push`).

**When would you need a manual retain?** Only if you are moving the unwrapped value across a **raw, non-assignment
boundary** — for example, storing it via `rt_memcpy` into a manually managed buffer. In normal L0 code, you should not
need to add `rt_string_retain` after `opt as string`.

## 6. Container Ownership Contracts

### 6.1 `std.vector` / `VectorString`

- `vs_push` uses assignment semantics: the compiler retains the incoming value and releases any overwritten slot.
- `vs_clear` and `vs_free` release all stored strings before clearing or freeing the underlying storage.
- The generic `vec_*` API is **not** ARC-aware — always use the `vs_*` helpers for string vectors.

**Caller rule:** do not manually release a string after `vs_push`; the container now owns it.

### 6.2 `std.hashmap` (`spm` / `sim`)

- Map **keys** are ARC strings owned by the map.
- Insert/update retains the new key and releases any replaced key.
- Remove/clear/free release all occupied keys.
- Rehash moves keys by byte-copy (`rt_memcpy`); old storage is freed without additional per-key release.
- `spm_keys` / `sim_keys` return a **caller-owned** `VectorString*` — you must call `vs_free` on it.

Value ownership:

- `spm` values are `void*` and caller-managed; the map does **not** drop or free pointees.
- `sim` values are plain `int`.

### 6.3 `std.hashset` (`ss`)

- Set keys are ARC strings owned by the set.
- Add/remove/clear/free follow the same retain/release discipline as hashmap keys.
- Rehash uses byte-copy ownership transfer.
- `ss_to_vector` returns a **caller-owned** `VectorString*` — call `vs_free` when done.

### 6.4 `std.linear_map`

- `LinearMapBase` is byte-oriented and does **not** provide deep-ownership semantics on its own.
- ARC-aware specializations (`lmss`, `lmis`) use assignment semantics for string fields and explicit release on
  remove/free paths.
- Swap-removal copies bytes to avoid extra assignment churn, but ownership rules still require explicit release when a
  slot is destroyed.

## 7. Manual `rt_string_{retain,release}`: When It's Required vs. Wrong

**Required** when:

1. You manage string-bearing storage through raw memory ops (`rt_memcpy`, `rt_memset`, slot zaps).
2. You implement container remove/clear/free loops over owned string slots.
3. You cross an explicit ownership boundary outside normal assignment semantics.

**Usually wrong** when:

1. You perform ordinary L0 assignment on ARC-managed fields or slots.
2. You use ARC-aware stdlib helpers that already handle ownership (`vs_*`, `lmss_*`, `lmis_*`, map/set key APIs).

## 8. Stage 2 Lexer/Parser Ownership Patterns

Recommended pattern for temporary allocations:

```
with (let x = create() => free(x))
```

On successful ownership transfer into a result node, null out the local owner to prevent double cleanup.

Common examples:

- Temporary vectors in parser helpers.
- Token/vector cleanup helpers that release payload strings.
- AST free helpers that release nested containers before dropping nodes.

## 9. Bug Reporting and Trace Validation

If you observe behavior that contradicts this reference:

1. **Stop and report** immediately.
2. Provide a minimal `.l0` reproducer.
3. Include the generated C excerpt showing the retain/release/drop sequence.
4. Include trace logs and triage output.

Recommended commands:

```bash
./l0c ... --gen ...
./compiler/stage2_l0/run_test_trace.sh <test-or-reproducer>
./compiler/stage2_l0/check_trace_log.py <stderr.log> --triage
```

For ownership-related Stage 2 changes, run the full finalization checks:

```bash
./compiler/stage2_l0/run_trace_tests.sh
./compiler/stage2_l0/run_test_trace.sh <test_name>
./compiler/stage2_l0/check_trace_log.py <stderr.log> --triage
```

Pass criteria:

- Analyzer exit code `0`.
- `leaked_object_ptrs=0`.
- `leaked_string_ptrs=0`.
- No definite trace or runtime errors.
