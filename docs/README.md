# Root Documentation Layout

This root `docs/` tree is for Dea-wide and monorepo-wide stable documentation.

Today it contains:

- Dea-wide current-state reference material
- Dea-wide normative specifications
- monorepo layout and shared automation documentation once stabilized
- Dea-wide reference/status documents that describe the project as a whole
- future cross-level design and release-process documents

Existing level-local stable documentation remains in the owning subtree such as `l0/docs/`.

Lifecycle artifacts do not live in `docs/`. Use the sibling `work/` tree instead:

- root `work/` for Dea-wide plans and proposals
- level-local `work/` trees such as `l0/work/` and `l1/work/` for level-owned plans and proposals

## Reference

Root reference docs live under `docs/reference/` and describe the whole Dea project rather than one language level.

Examples:

- overall project status
- monorepo-wide release/status policy
- cross-level architecture notes once they exist

Language-specific references live in the owning subtree such as `l0/docs/reference/`.

## Specs

Root specs live under `docs/specs/` and define Dea-wide contracts that are not owned by one level.

Examples:

- shared compiler contracts and catalogs
- future cross-level release or compatibility policy

Language-specific specs live in the owning subtree such as `l0/docs/specs/`.
