# Root Work Layout

This root `work/` tree is for Dea-wide and monorepo-wide lifecycle artifacts.

Use `docs/` for stable current-state or normative material. Use `work/` for documents whose purpose is planning,
proposal discussion, implementation tracking, or closure history.

Today this tree contains:

- shared plans that span more than one language level or the monorepo itself
- future shared proposals that are not yet accepted into `docs/`
- closed history for shared work items

## Layout

- `plans/` for execution plans and operational work tracking
- `proposals/` for future or in-discussion changes not yet accepted as canonical

Create subdirectories only when they are needed for real documents.

## Shared Plans

Root plans live under `work/plans/` and use these categories:

- `features/`
- `bug-fixes/`
- `refactors/`
- `tools/`

Active plans live at the category root. Closed plans live under `<category>/closed/`.

Use a root shared plan by default when any of these are true:

- the same fix or refactor spans multiple levels or compiler stages
- one implementation was seeded from another and the change should transfer
- the design decision is shared even if code lands in more than one subtree

Shared plans stay open until every in-scope target is implemented or explicitly deferred.

Required shared-plan metadata, in addition to the standard plan block:

- `Scope: Shared`
- `Targets:` one line per in-scope implementation
- `Origin:` where the design or first implementation is expected to settle
- `Porting rule:` whether downstream should be a mechanical port or may diverge intentionally
- `Target status:` one line per target using `Pending`, `In Progress`, `Implemented`, or `Deferred: <reason>`

Do not open a separate level-local follow-up plan just to port a mechanical parity fix already covered by a shared root
plan.
