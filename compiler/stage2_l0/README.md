# Stage 2 Dea/L0 Language Compiler

This directory will contain the Stage 2 Dea/L0 compiler.

The Stage 2 L0 compiler is the self-hosted compiler for the L0 programming language, i.e., the compiler that is written
in L0 itself.

It is designed to compile L0 source code into C99 code (like the Stage 1 compiler implemented in Python).
