### Create a new Dea plan

Use this skill when the user asks to add, draft, open, or write a new Dea plan or other lifecycle work item.

Do not use this skill for:

- stable reference/spec/status docs that belong under `docs/`
- closing or finalizing an already implemented plan
- a body of work that should be an initiative instead of a single plan

## Cross-level default rule

Treat plan rules as shared across `l0/`, `l1/`, and future `lN/` subtrees unless an explicit subtree or root rule says
otherwise.

That means:

- start from the root `CLAUDE.md` and the shared `work/README.md` policy first
- assume the same category, filename, metadata, and lifecycle rules apply across levels by default
- only introduce subtree-specific behavior when the relevant subtree docs explicitly define a narrower rule

## Required context

1. Read root `CLAUDE.md` first.
2. Read `work/README.md` when the work may be shared across levels or monorepo-owned.
3. If the scope is subtree-local, read that subtree's `CLAUDE.md` and `work/README.md`.
4. Read additional subtree docs only when that subtree has an explicit local planning rule that affects placement,
   linking, or metadata.
5. Inspect nearby active and closed plans in the target category before drafting so the new file matches current local
   naming and section conventions.
6. If scope, category, or ownership is ambiguous, clarify before writing the plan.

## Decide the right artifact first

1. **Stable current-state or normative content** belongs in `docs/`, not `work/`.
2. **One bounded change or work item** belongs in a plan.
3. **A coordinated multi-phase body of work whose phases will spawn future plans** belongs in an initiative instead.
4. **Shared parity, seeded-port, or monorepo-wide work** should usually use one root-owned shared plan under `work/`,
   not separate follow-up plans in multiple level subtrees.

Never place a lifecycle plan under `docs/`. Plans belong under the matching `work/` tree unless an explicit rule says
otherwise.

## Choose the correct location

### Root shared plans

Use the repository-root `work/` tree when any of these are true:

- the same fix or refactor spans multiple levels or compiler stages
- one implementation was seeded from another and the change should transfer
- the design decision is shared even if code lands in more than one subtree
- the work is monorepo-wide rather than owned by a single level

Create the file under:

- `work/plans/features/`
- `work/plans/bug-fixes/`
- `work/plans/refactors/`
- `work/plans/tools/`

### Level-local plans

Use `<level>/work/plans/<kind>/` when the work is owned only by that subtree, for example:

- `l0/work/plans/<kind>/`
- `l1/work/plans/<kind>/`
- future `lN/work/plans/<kind>/`

Assume this same subtree-local placement rule for future levels unless a later subtree doc explicitly narrows it.

### Active vs closed

- New plans start at the category root.
- Closed plans move later into `<category>/closed/`.

Do not create the file directly under `closed/`.

## Choose the correct category

- `features/`: user-visible language, compiler, runtime, stdlib, or product capabilities
- `bug-fixes/`: defects, regressions, parity mismatches, incorrect diagnostics, broken workflows
- `refactors/`: internal restructures that preserve current external behavior
- `tools/`: repo tooling, CI/CD, docs tooling, runners, packaging, install/dist workflows, helper scripts

If the work is primarily about wrong current behavior, default to `bug-fixes/` even if the implementation touches many
subsystems.

## Filename rules

Plan filenames use this shape:

```text
YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-noref.md
```

Rules:

- Use the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` form.
- Keep the final `-noref.md` suffix.
- Make the slug specific enough to identify the work from the filename alone.
- Do not use generic slugs such as `plan`, `new-feature`, or `compiler-fix`.
- Match nearby local naming idioms in the target tree.

Current repo conventions to follow:

- root shared plans often use a `shared-...` slug when the shared scope should be explicit
- level-local plans may use an explicit level or stage prefix such as `l1-...`, `stage1-...`, or `stage2-...` when that
  is already the clearest established local precedent

Use the clearest current local precedent rather than forcing a new naming style.

## Metadata block

Start every new plan with the standard plan header and metadata block.

### Level-local plan template

```markdown
# [Bug Fix | Feature | Refactor | Tool] Plan

## [Short title]

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Draft
- Title: [Full descriptive title]
- Kind: [Bug Fix | Feature | Refactor | Tooling]
- Severity: [Low | Medium | High | Critical]
- Stage: [match nearby plans in the target tree]
- Subsystem: [subsystem summary]
- Modules:
  - `path/to/module`
- Test modules:
  - `path/to/test`
- Related:
  - `path/to/related-plan-or-doc.md`
- Repro: `command or focused repro`
```

Notes:

- New plans should normally start with `Status: Draft`.
- `# Tool Plan` pairs with `Kind: Tooling`.
- Include `Related:` when there are meaningful links; omit it only when there is nothing useful to reference.
- Include `Repro:` when there is a concrete repro command, fixture, or focused entrypoint.
- Use the stage/value style already used by nearby plans in the same tree and category.

### Root shared-plan extra metadata

Root shared plans need the standard block plus these required fields:

```markdown
- Scope: Shared
- Targets:
  - [target implementation]
- Origin: [where the design or first implementation settles]
- Porting rule: [mechanical port or intentional divergence rule]
- Target status:
  - [target]: Pending
```

For shared plans:

- use `Stage: Shared`
- include one `Targets:` line per in-scope implementation
- include one `Target status:` line per target using `Pending`, `In Progress`, `Implemented`, or `Deferred: <reason>`

## Body structure rules

After the metadata block, follow the structure already used by nearby plans in the same tree. For a new draft plan, the
body usually needs at least:

- `## Summary`
- current-state and/or root-cause context
- goal/scope
- phased implementation or approach sections
- non-goals
- verification criteria

Use the closest local precedent:

- bug-fix plans often include `## Current State`, `## Root Cause`, `## Scope of This Fix`, `## Approach`, or explicit
  hypotheses to resolve
- feature and tooling plans often include `## Defaults Chosen`, `## Goal`, `## Implementation Phases`, and
  `## Verification Criteria`
- shared plans often include target-specific status and porting guidance

Do not write an `Outcome`, `Results`, or completed verification section in a brand-new draft plan unless the user is
actually documenting already landed work.

## Explicit subtree link and update rules

Only apply subtree-specific link/update work when the subtree docs explicitly require it.

Current explicit rule:

If you create a new L1-local lifecycle artifact, update `l1/docs/roadmap.md` in the same change:

- standalone plans go under `## Active standalone plans`
- initiatives go under `## Active initiatives`

When editing `l1/docs/roadmap.md`, refresh its `Version: YYYY-MM-DD` metadata if needed.

### Roadmap link legibility rules

For legibility, the visible link text in `roadmap.md` uses special abbreviated forms. These rules apply only inside
`roadmap.md`; everywhere else, follow the general "repository-root paths as visible link text" rule from the writing
rules below.

- plans: `[plan-slug](../work/plans/<kind>/plan-slug.md)` — visible text is the bare plan slug, without the `.md`
  extension and without the `../work/plans/<kind>/` prefix
- initiatives: `[NNNN-initiative-slug](../work/initiatives/NNNN-initiative-slug.md)` — visible text is the bare
  `NNNN-initiative-slug`, without the `.md` extension
- other documents: visible text is just the filename without extension, for example
  `[design-decisions](reference/design-decisions.md)` or `[project-status](project-status.md)`

Apply these rules to every link added to `roadmap.md`, including cross-references inside backlog bullets, not just the
`Active standalone plans` / `Active initiatives` entries.

## Initiative handoff rule

If the request clearly needs an initiative instead of a plan, do not force it into `plans/`.

Use a subtree-local initiative workflow only when that subtree explicitly documents one.

Current explicit example:

For L1, initiatives live at:

```text
l1/work/initiatives/NNNN-kebab-case-slug.md
```

Use the next available zero-padded number, carry the initiative metadata block, and add the roadmap entry under
`Active initiatives`.

## Writing rules

- Keep the plan factual, concrete, and scoped to the actual work item.
- Do not document draft future work as shipped behavior in stable docs.
- Use repository-root paths as visible Markdown link text for repo files.
- Prefer explicit module/test lists over vague subsystem descriptions.
- Match the formatting and section style of nearby current plans instead of inventing a new template variation.
- If the user asked only for the plan, do not implement code changes.

## Deliverable checklist

- correct artifact type chosen
- correct `work/` tree selected
- correct category selected
- filename follows `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-noref.md`
- metadata block matches current repo rules
- shared-plan metadata included when needed
- explicit subtree link/update steps followed where required, for example the current `l1/docs/roadmap.md` rule
- no lifecycle plan written under `docs/`
