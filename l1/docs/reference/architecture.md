# L1 Compiler Architecture

Version: 2026-04-18

This is the canonical architecture document for the current Dea/L1 bootstrap compiler.

Today there is one implemented compiler pipeline:

- `compiler/stage1_l0/` contains the runnable L1 compiler implemented in Dea/L0.
- `compiler/stage2_l1/` is reserved for the future self-hosted compiler and is not implemented yet.
- `compiler/shared/l1/stdlib/` and `compiler/shared/runtime/l1_runtime.h` are the current shared library/runtime inputs
  consumed by the bootstrap toolchain.

Related canonical docs:

- Backend lowering and generated C details: [c-backend-design.md](c-backend-design.md)
- Language/runtime rationale and policy: [design-decisions.md](design-decisions.md)
- Bootstrap status snapshot: [l1/docs/project-status.md](../project-status.md)

## 1. High-Level Pipeline

### 1.1 Current Implemented Pipeline

```
Source (.l1)
  |
  v
lexer.l0 -> Token stream
  |
  v
parser.l0 -> AST
  |
  v
name_resolver.l0 -> ModuleEnv per module
  |
  v
signatures.l0 -> func/struct/enum/let type tables
  |
  v
locals.l0 -> FunctionEnv per function
  |
  v
expr_types.l0 -> expression types + semantic diagnostics
  |
  v
backend.l0 + c_emitter.l0 -> single C99 translation unit
  |
  v
build_driver.l0 -> host C compiler invocation (`--build` / `--run`)
  |
  v
Executable launch (`--run`)
```

Current CLI entry point: `compiler/stage1_l0/src/l1c.l0`.

Normal developer workflow:

```bash
make use-dev-stage1
source build/dea/bin/l1-env.sh
l1c --help
```

`make use-dev-stage1` auto-prepares the default repo-local upstream `../l0/build/dea/bin/l0c-stage2` when needed.

## 2. Pass Responsibilities

All current implementation modules live under `compiler/stage1_l0/src/`.

### 2.1 Lexer (`lexer.l0`, `tokens.l0`)

- Converts UTF-8 source text to token streams.
- Tracks source locations for diagnostics.
- Recognizes keywords, literals, punctuation, and operators.

### 2.2 Parser (`parser.l0`, `ast.l0`)

- Produces the current AST for modules, declarations, statements, and expressions.
- Enforces statement-vs-expression syntax boundaries such as assignment remaining statement-only.

### 2.3 Name Resolution (`name_resolver.l0`, `symbols.l0`)

- Builds module environments across the import closure.
- Resolves opened imports and reports ambiguity diagnostics.

### 2.4 Signature Resolution (`signatures.l0`, `type_resolve.l0`, `types.l0`)

- Resolves top-level type references.
- Populates function, struct, enum, and top-level binding type tables.
- Detects alias and type-dependency cycles.

### 2.5 Local Resolution (`locals.l0`, `scope_context.l0`, `sem_context.l0`)

- Builds per-function lexical scope state.
- Tracks local bindings and control-flow-sensitive semantic context.

### 2.6 Expression Typing (`expr_types.l0`)

- Checks expression and statement typing.
- Validates return-path and cleanup-path requirements.
- Produces semantic diagnostics without crashing the compiler.

### 2.7 Backend (`backend.l0`, `c_emitter.l0`, `string_escape.l0`)

- Consumes typed analysis results and emits one C99 translation unit.
- Delegates backend-specific behavior to [c-backend-design.md](c-backend-design.md).

### 2.8 Driver and CLI (`driver.l0`, `l1c_lib.l0`, `cli_args.l0`, `build_driver.l0`)

- Coordinates the pass pipeline.
- Implements CLI mode dispatch and host compiler execution.
- Produces generated C, built executables, or direct runs depending on CLI mode.

## 3. Core Data Flow

Primary aggregates in the current implementation include:

- token streams from `tokens.l0`
- parsed AST nodes from `ast.l0`
- module and symbol environments from `name_resolver.l0`
- typed semantic state from `analysis.l0`

Important analysis tables include:

- `module_envs`
- `func_types`
- `struct_infos`
- `enum_infos`
- `func_envs`
- `let_types`
- `expr_types`
- `var_ref_resolution`
- `intrinsic_targets`
- `diagnostics`

## 4. Invariants

1. The current L1 compiler is bootstrap-only and implemented in Dea/L0.
2. Import closure construction is explicit and checked before later semantic passes.
3. Source locations are propagated for diagnostics.
4. Diagnostic columns follow a logical-source contract: every non-newline source byte, including ASCII horizontal tabs,
   advances the stored column by exactly one. Snippet rendering normalizes displayed source lines to the same model
   (each tab is printed as a single space) so the caret underline and the displayed line always agree, independent of
   terminal tab-stop behavior. Unicode display-width handling is out of scope for this contract.
5. Semantic failures are reported as diagnostics rather than internal crashes on normal invalid input paths.
6. Generated output is currently one C99 translation unit.
7. Any future `stage2_l1` implementation should match the public L1 language/runtime behavior documented here and in the
   other L1 reference documents.

## 5. File/Module Layout

Main current compiler modules under `compiler/stage1_l0/src/`:

- `analysis.l0`
- `ast.l0`
- `backend.l0`
- `build_driver.l0`
- `cli_args.l0`
- `driver.l0`
- `expr_types.l0`
- `l1c.l0`
- `l1c_lib.l0`
- `lexer.l0`
- `locals.l0`
- `name_resolver.l0`
- `parser.l0`
- `signatures.l0`
- `string_escape.l0`
- `tokens.l0`
- `type_resolve.l0`
- `types.l0`

## 6. Host and Toolchain Assumptions

- Source decoding is UTF-8 with optional BOM stripping.
- L1 source modules use the `.l1` extension.
- The bootstrap compiler implementation remains `.l0` source code.
- `--build` and `--run` require a host C99 toolchain.
- Local bootstrap builds use `../l0/build/dea/bin/l0c-stage2` by default unless overridden with `L1_BOOTSTRAP_L0C`.
