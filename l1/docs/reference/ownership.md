# L1 Ownership and Memory Management Reference

Version: 2026-04-02

This document describes how ownership works in current Dea/L1 bootstrap builds, covering:

- `new` / `drop` heap object lifetime
- ARC-managed `string`
- ownership rules for the copied L1 stdlib containers
- optional-string unwrap behavior

## Scope and Status

- The ground truth is the current bootstrap implementation in `compiler/stage1_l0/` plus the shared L1 stdlib/runtime.
- `compiler/stage2_l1/` is not implemented yet, so this document describes only current bootstrap behavior.
- If runtime or codegen behavior differs from this document, treat that as a bug.

## 1. Ownership Model at a Glance

L1 currently uses three cooperating lifetime systems:

1. `new` / `drop` for heap-allocated objects
2. ARC for `string`
3. container-level ownership rules inside stdlib collections

These systems are separate:

- `_rt_drop` frees memory allocated by `new`
- `rt_string_release` frees a string payload when its refcount reaches zero
- dropping an object does not recursively free unrelated child pointers for you

## 2. Normative Rules Matrix

| Operation                                                                   | Ownership result                      | What you need to do                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `let p = new T(...)`                                                        | Caller owns the heap object           | Call `drop p` exactly once unless you transfer ownership deliberately.                                         |
| Normal L1 assignment of a `string` (`dst = s`, `*dest = val`, field assign) | Destination takes a managed reference | The compiler emits retain/release automatically. Do not add manual retain/release around ordinary assignments. |
| Removing or clearing string entries from raw storage                        | Container owns stored strings         | Release owned strings before zeroing or removing the storage.                                                  |
| Byte-copy move (`rt_memcpy`) of string-bearing data                         | Ownership moves with the bytes        | Do not release the moved-from slot again.                                                                      |
| `string` returned by value from a container helper                          | Caller receives a managed value       | Follow normal ARC lifetime unless crossing a raw-memory boundary.                                              |
| `return local_var` where `local_var` is owned                               | Ownership moves to caller             | Backend may skip final cleanup for that binding.                                                               |
| `return expr` for a non-local/non-owned value                               | Caller receives a managed reference   | Backend retains the result before scope cleanup.                                                               |

## 3. `new` / `drop` Semantics

Current lowering policy:

- `new` lowers to runtime allocation helpers
- `drop` lowers to runtime deallocation helpers
- `new Struct` and `new Struct()` allocate one zero-initialized object
- `new Struct(args...)` allocates and initializes fields positionally
- `new Variant(args...)` allocates the owning enum object for that active variant
- `drop` accepts both `T*` and `T*?`
- dropping `null` is a safe no-op

Before calling the final drop helper, compiler-generated cleanup may release owned fields such as `string` members.
Pointer children with independent ownership are still your responsibility.

## 4. ARC `string` Semantics

Every runtime `string` value is reference-counted.

In normal code:

- ordinary assignments are ARC-balanced by the compiler
- local scope cleanup releases initialized owned values
- explicit retain/release calls are reserved for raw-memory boundaries and low-level container internals

## 5. Optional Unwrap

When you unwrap `string?` with `opt as string`, the resulting `string` is ownership-stabilized by the backend.

In ordinary L1 code, you should not need to add a compensating manual retain after `opt as string`.

## 6. Container Ownership Contracts

### `std.vector` / `VectorString`

- `vs_push` uses assignment semantics
- `vs_clear` and `vs_free` release stored strings before clearing/freeing storage
- the generic `vec_*` layer is not ARC-aware by itself

### `std.hashmap`

- map keys are ARC strings owned by the map
- insert/update retains new keys and releases replaced keys
- remove/clear/free release all occupied keys
- `spm_keys` and `sim_keys` return caller-owned `VectorString*`

### `std.hashset`

- set keys are ARC strings owned by the set
- add/remove/clear/free follow the same retain/release discipline as map keys
- `ss_to_vector` returns caller-owned `VectorString*`

### `std.linear_map`

- `LinearMapBase` is byte-oriented and does not provide deep ownership on its own
- ARC-aware specializations release owned strings on remove/free paths

## 7. Manual `rt_string_retain` / `rt_string_release`

Manual retain/release is required when you:

1. manipulate string-bearing storage through raw memory operations
2. implement remove/clear/free loops for owned string slots
3. cross an ownership boundary outside ordinary assignment semantics

It is usually wrong when you:

1. perform ordinary assignment on ARC-managed fields or locals
2. use stdlib helpers that already own the ARC transitions for you

## 8. Control Flow and Cleanup

Current compiler behavior:

- scope cleanup runs in reverse declaration order
- `continue` cleans only the current iteration body scope before control returns to the loop update/condition path
- `return`, `break`, and `expr?` early exits run pending `with` cleanup before ordinary owned-value cleanup
- direct return of an owned local may be treated as a move

## 9. Validation and Bug Reporting

For ownership issues, provide:

1. a minimal `.l1` reproducer
2. the generated C excerpt showing retain/release/drop order
3. trace logs when applicable

Useful local checks:

```bash
make build-stage1
source build/l1/bin/l1-env.sh
l1c --gen examples/hello.l1
python compiler/stage1_l0/run_trace_tests.py
```
