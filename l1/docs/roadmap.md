# Dea/L1 Roadmap

Version: 2026-04-17

This is the live direction document for the Dea/L1 subtree. It records the current L1 position, the assumptions that
constrain future work, completed milestones that shape the baseline, active work, and backlog items that have not yet
been promoted to initiatives or plans.

L1 is currently a bootstrap subtree, not a release-bearing product. L0 remains the active user-facing release line while
L1 carries post-L0 language growth and bootstrap compiler work.

## Current position

- `compiler/stage1_l0/` is the only implemented L1 compiler today.
- `compiler/stage2_l1/` is a placeholder for a future self-hosted L1 compiler.
- The current L1 runtime and stdlib inputs live under `compiler/shared/runtime/` and `compiler/shared/l1/stdlib/`.
- The current backend emits one C99 translation unit per program.
- L1 local development defaults to the repo-local upstream L0 Stage 2 compiler at `../l0/build/dea/bin/l0c-stage2`, or
  an explicit `L1_BOOTSTRAP_L0C` override.
- Exact generated-C golden-file parity and L1 triple-bootstrap are not part of the current Stage 1 contract.

## Roadmap assumptions

- L1 should preserve the current bootstrap compiler and documented semantics unless a targeted bug fix, planned feature,
  or accepted initiative changes them.
- L1 work stays in `l1/` unless it is genuinely Dea-wide or shared with L0; shared work belongs under root `work/`.
- Closed plans document shipped L1 baseline decisions. Draft plans and active initiatives describe intended work, not
  implemented behavior.
- Any future `stage2_l1` implementation should preserve the L1 language/runtime decisions documented in
  [l1/docs/reference/design-decisions.md](reference/design-decisions.md) unless the reference set is deliberately
  updated.
- The L1 public C ABI should continue using the `dea_*` / `DEA_*` naming policy. Historical `l0_*` names are not part of
  the current L1 ABI except for documented temporary internal compatibility such as `l0_siphash.h`.
- The first L1 productization steps should remain bootstrap-oriented until a later plan explicitly makes L1 a release
  line.

  adds the planned `std.real` / `sys.real` floating-point library surface.

## Backlog

These items are future directions that need plans or initiatives before implementation. Items with partial current
coverage call out the implemented baseline so the backlog does not imply missing work where L1 already has a narrower
surface.

### Language core

- Separate compilation, runtime-library split, external linking, and C FFI, including C boundary string design, tracked
  by Initiative
  [l1/work/initiatives/0001-separate-compilation-and-c-ffi.md](../work/initiatives/0001-separate-compilation-and-c-ffi.md).
- Bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`). The tokens are reserved and currently produce explicit
  not-yet-supported diagnostics.
- `const` declarations, including top-level `const` and their compile-time initializer and ABI rules.
- Varargs, with an explicit split between L1 variadic functions and C variadic FFI support.
- Function pointer types, calls, nullability, and C ABI representation.
- Lambdas/closures, including capture, ownership, and lowering rules.
- Generics and generic modules.
- Typed arrays, buffers, shared buffers, and slices as general language features. The current `std.array` / `std.vector`
  surface is library-level storage, not typed language-level arrays or slices.
- Unsafe module boundaries and raw pointer operations, including address-of (`&`) semantics and pointer indexing /
  addressing gates. Current `sys.unsafe` is a low-level runtime binding only.
- `_` struct-member semantics: whether placeholder/discard fields are allowed and how they affect construction, field
  access, layout, and ABI.
- `is` predicate/intrinsic over enum or type ordinals, including whether it stays a narrow `ord`-comparison helper or
  becomes the first RTTI-facing surface.
- Named arguments for functions and constructors.
- Literal struct/enum syntax using `{}` and named fields. Constructor-call syntax exists today; literal syntax does not.
- Compiler-generated `hash(T)` for struct and enum values, including its relationship to `sys.hash`, `std.hashmap`, and
  ABI stability.
- Diagnostic UX improvements: fuller messages, fix-it hints, parse recovery, and dedicated diagnostics for common
  unexpected-token cases such as `else` without `if`, `cleanup` without `with`, and stray semicolons.

### Standard library

- File-handle I/O: `open`, incremental `read` / `write`, append, and seek. Whole-file `std.fs::read_file` /
  `std.fs::write_file` and stdin/stdout byte helpers already exist.
- Directory traversal APIs. Current `std.fs` exposes path metadata and `is_dir`, but not directory iteration.
- Stream abstractions for files, standard streams, memory buffers, and later transport-backed endpoints.
- Data-format modules such as JSON and IFF.

### Runtime

- Runtime profiling hooks and reporting.
- Full call-stack tracing for runtime/compiler failure paths, separate from the current ARC and memory trace toggles.
- Custom allocators and arenas as a language/runtime facility, including their interaction with `new`, `drop`, ARC, and
  stdlib containers.

### Tooling and delivery

- Self-hosted `stage2_l1` compiler implementation and eventual Stage 1/Stage 2 parity validation.
- Release-bearing L1 install, distribution, release, and docs-publishing workflows after the bootstrap productization
  plan lands.
- Broader L1 CI/CD and tooling beyond bootstrap packaging, including validation matrices and published artifact checks.

## Deferred direction

These items are known explicit deferrals: these are not currently planned for L1 and would require a future roadmap
update to be promoted to an initiative or plan:

- Advanced floating-point modules and intrinsics beyond the `std.real` / `sys.real` surface.
- File-watch APIs.
- Networking APIs.
- Concurrency runtime primitives, shared concurrent data structures, and CSP-style threads.
- General RTTI/reflection beyond a narrow `is` predicate.
- Traits, interfaces, or mixins.
- Macros.
- Alternate non-C backends such as LLVM, WASM/JS, JVM, or Go.
- Package management, manifests, and dependency resolution.
