# L1 Stage 1 Compiler Seed

This directory contains the initial `stage1_l0` compiler seed for Dea/L1.

`stage1_l0` means the compiler is implemented in Dea/L0. It is seeded from the runnable Dea/L0 Stage 2 compiler and
retargeted to the Dea/L1 public interface.

The implementation sources in this subtree remain `.l0`, and the copied implementation test suite is also `.l0`. Those
tests are exercised through the upstream `l0c-stage2` bootstrap compiler rather than through `l1c` itself. The fixture
programs and copied L1 stdlib modules that those tests compile as L1-language inputs now use the `.l1` extension.

Stage 1 validation here is limited to those `.l0` implementation tests and their focused backend/emitter assertions.
Committed full-file generated-C golden checks are intentionally out of scope for the current Stage 1 bootstrap contract.

Run the local bootstrap workflow from [`l1/`](../../README.md):

```bash
make use-dev-stage1
source build/dea/bin/l1-env.sh
l1c --version
```

`make use-dev-stage1` auto-prepares the default repo-local upstream `../../l0/build/dea/bin/l0c-stage2` when needed.

`make docker CMD=test-all` runs the explicit Linux container validation path while preserving that same default
repo-local `../../l0` bootstrap layout.

For a non-default upstream bootstrap compiler, set `L1_BOOTSTRAP_L0C=/path/to/l0c-stage2` when running
`make build-stage1`.
