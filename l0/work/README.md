# L0 Work Layout

This `l0/work/` tree holds lifecycle-bound documents for the Dea/L0 subtree.

Use `l0/docs/` for stable references, specs, implementation notes, and user guides. Use `l0/work/` for plans, proposals,
and archived execution history.

## Layout

- `plans/` for execution plans and operational work tracking
- `proposals/` for future or in-discussion changes not yet accepted as canonical

Plan categories:

- `plans/features/`: user-facing language, compiler, or standard-library features
- `plans/tools/`: repository tooling and operational workflows
- `plans/refactors/`: internal restructures that preserve current external behavior
- `plans/bug-fixes/`: defect fixes in any subsystem

Each plan category uses:

- active plans at the category root
- closed plans under `<category>/closed/`
- plan attachments under `<category>/attachments/` when needed

When closing a plan, `git mv` it into the corresponding `closed/` subdirectory, then grep for its filename across
`l0/docs/`, `l0/work/`, and any shared root docs/work files and update cross-references.

## Plan Template

```markdown
# [Bug Fix | Feature | Refactor | Tool] Plan

## [Short Title]

- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: [Draft | In Progress | Closed (fixed/implemented)]
- Title: [Full descriptive title]
- Kind: [Bug Fix | Feature | Refactor | Tooling]
- Severity: [Low | Medium | High | Critical]
- Stage: [1 | 2 | Shared]
- Subsystem: [Subsystem name]
- Modules:
  - `path/to/module.l0`
- Test modules:

## Summary

...
```

Accepted proposals should graduate into `l0/docs/specs/`, `l0/docs/reference/`, or `l0/docs/implementation/` rather than
remaining under `l0/work/`.
